## 📋 Overview

AstronRPA is an enterprise-grade Robotic Process Automation (RPA) desktop application. Through a visual designer, it supports low-code/no-code development, enabling users to rapidly build workflows and automate desktop software and web pages.

[Astron Agent](https://github.com/iflytek/astron-agent) is the native Agent platform supported by this project. Users can directly call RPA workflow nodes in Astron Agent, and also use Agent workflows in AstronRPA, achieving efficient collaboration between automation processes and intelligent agent systems, empowering broader business automation scenarios.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### System Requirements
- 💻 **Client Operating System**: Windows 10/11 (primary support)
- 🧠 **RAM** >= 8 GiB

### **Server**: Deploy with Docker

Recommended for quick deployment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/iflytek/astron-rpa.git
cd astron-rpa

# Enter docker directory
cd docker

# Copy .env
cp .env.example .env

# Modify casdoor service configuration in .env (8000 is the default port)
CASDOOR_EXTERNAL_ENDPOINT="http://{YOUR_SERVER_IP}:8000"

# 🚀 Start all services
docker compose up -d

# 📊 Check service status
docker compose ps
```

- After all services have started, open your browser and go to: `http://{YOUR_SERVER_IP}:32742/api/rpa-auth/user/login-check` (32742 is the default port; change it if you modified the configuration).
- If you see `{"code":"900001","data":null,"message":"unauthorized"}`, it means the deployment is correct and the connection is working properly.
- Open your browser and go to: `http://{YOUR_SERVER_IP}:8000` (8000 is the default port; change it if you modified the configuration).
- If you see the Casdoor login page, it means Casdoor is deployed correctly.
- For production deployment and security hardening, refer to the [Deployment Guide](./docker/QUICK_START.md).

### **Client**: Source Deployment/Binary Deployment

#### Environment Dependencies
| Tool | Version | Description |
|-----|---------|------------|
| **Node.js** | >= 22 | JavaScript runtime |
| **Python** | 3.13.x | RPA engine core |
| **Java** | JDK 8+ | Backend runtime |
| **pnpm** | >= 9 | Node.js package manager |
| **UV** | 0.8+ | Python package management tool |
| **7-Zip** | - | Create deployment archives |
| **SWIG** | - | Connect Python with C/C++ |

For specific installation instructions and common issues, refer to [Build Guide](./BUILD_GUIDE.md).

#### Direct Download (Recommended)

Download the latest [Release Package](https://github.com/iflytek/astron-rpa/releases)

#### One-Click Build

1. **Prepare Python Environment**
   ```bash
   # Prepare a Python 3.13.x installation directory (can be a local folder or system installation path)
   # The script will copy this directory to create python_core
   ```

2. **Run Build Script**
   ```bash
   # Full build (engine + frontend + desktop app) from project root directory
   ./build.bat --python-exe "C:\Program Files\Python313\python.exe"
   
   # Or use default configuration (if Python is in default path)
   ./build.bat
   
   # Wait for completion
   # Build successful when console displays "Full Build Complete!"
   ```

   > **Note:** Please ensure the specified Python interpreter is a clean installation without additional third-party packages to minimize package size.

   **Build process includes:**
   1. ✅ Detect/copy Python environment to `build/python_core`
   2. ✅ Install RPA engine dependencies
   3. ✅ Compress Python core to `resources/python_core.7z`
   4. ✅ Install frontend dependencies
   5. ✅ Build frontend web application
   6. ✅ Build desktop application

3. 📦 Install the packaged client

#### ⚙️ After installation, modify the server address in `resources/conf.yaml` in the installation directory:

    ```yaml
    # 32742 is the default port; change it if you modified the configuration
    remote_addr: http://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS:32742/
    skip_engine_start: false
    ```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The project adopts a frontend-backend separation architecture. The frontend is built with Vue 3 + TypeScript and Electron for desktop applications; the backend uses Java Spring Boot and Python FastAPI to build microservices supporting business and AI capabilities. The engine layer is based on Python, integrating 20+ RPA components with support for image recognition and UI automation. The entire system is deployed via Docker with high observability and scalability, designed for complex RPA scenarios.
